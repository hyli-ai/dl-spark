# Data Lake (Apache Spark)
>
In this project, an data lake and an ETL pipeline are built using Apache Spark that extracts data from S3, processes the data into analytic tables, and loads them back to S3.

## Introduction

### Scenario
A music streaming startup, Sparkify, has grown their user base and song database even more and want to move their data warehouse to a data lake. Their data resides in S3, in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

### Goal
The goal of this project, as a data engineer, is to build an ETL pipeline that extracts their data from S3, processes them using Spark, and loads the data back into S3 as a set of dimensional tables. This will allow their analytics team to continue finding insights in what songs their users are listening to.

## Project Description
In this project, you'll apply what you've learned on Spark and data lakes to build an ETL pipeline for a data lake hosted on S3. To complete the project, you will need to load data from S3, process the data into analytics tables using Spark, and load them back into S3. You'll deploy this Spark process on a cluster using AWS.

* Build an ETL pipeline for for a data lake hosted on S3 based on the knowledge of Spark and data lakes.

* Load data from S3, process the data into analytics tables using Spark, and load them back into S3.

* Deploy this Spark process on a cluster using AWS.

## Dataset
Two sets of data are presented: the **Song Dataset** and the **Log Dataset**. These datasets reside in S3, and here are the S3 links for each:

* Song data: `s3://udacity-dend/song_data`
* Log data: `s3://udacity-dend/log_data`

### Song Dataset
The first dataset is a subset of real data from the [Million Song Dataset](https://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/). Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.

```
song_data/A/B/C/TRABCEI128F424C983.json
song_data/A/A/B/TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json
```

And below is an example of what a single song file, **TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json**, looks like.

```json
{"num_songs": 1, "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7", "artist_latitude": null, "artist_longitude": null, "artist_location": "", "artist_name": "Line Renaud", "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1", "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff", "duration": 152.92036, "year": 0}
```

### Log Dataset
The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this [event simulator](https://github.com/Interana/eventsim) based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate activity logs from a music streaming app based on specified configurations.

The log files in the dataset are partitioned by year and month. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.

```
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-12-events.json
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-13-events.json
```

And below is an example of what the data in a log file, **2018-11-12-events.json**, looks like.

## Database and the Star Schema Design
Using the song and log datasets, a star schema optimized for queries on song play analysis was created based on the following entity-relationship (ER) diagram:
![ER Diagram](/ERD.png)

This includes the following tables:
### Fact Table
1. **songplays** - records in log data associated with song plays i.e. records with page `NextSong`
    * *songplay_id, start_time, user_id, level, song_id, artist_id, session_id, location, user_agent*
### Dimension Tables
1. **users** - users in the app
    * *user_id, first_name, last_name, gender, level*
2. **songs** - songs in music database
    * *song_id, title, artist_id, year, duration*
3. **artists** - artists in music database
    * *artist_id, name, location, latitude, longitude*
4. **time** - timestamps of records in **songplays** broken down into specific units
    * *start_time, hour, day, week, month, year, weekday*

## Files in this Project
This project workspace includes three files:

1. `etl.py` reads data from S3, processes that data using Spark, and writes them back to S3.

2. `dl.cfg` contains the AWS credentials.

3. `README.md` provide discussion on your process and decisions for this ETL pipeline.

## Project Instructions


### Create Table Schema


### Build ETL Pipeline


### Notes
1. On the retrival of the `song_data`, only files in the path `song_data/A/A/A/*.json` are processed for simplicity.
